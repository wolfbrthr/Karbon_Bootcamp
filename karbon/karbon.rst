Overview
++++++++

Nutanix Karbon is an on-prem turnkey curated enterprise-grade Kubernetes service offering that simplifies the provisioning, operations and lifecycle management of Kubernetes.

Karbon provides a consumer-grade experience for delivering Kubernetes on-prem providing huge savings on OpEx of dedicated DevOps or SRE teams to keep Kubernetes online, up to date or integrated with 3rd party components and tooling.

**In this lab you will deploy a Kubernetes cluster using Karbon and then deploy multiple containers, referred to as Kubernetes pods, to run a sample application.**

If you already have an understanding of containers, Kubernetes, challenges, and use cases, jump to `Lab Setup`_ and `Creating a Karbon Cluster`_.

What are Containers?
....................

A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another. Unlike traditional virtualization, containers are substantially more light-weight than VMs, with many containers capable of sharing the same host OS instance.

.. figure:: images/overview1.png

Containers provide two key features: a packaging mechanism and a runtime environment.

At the runtime level, the container allows an application to run as an isolated process with its own view of the operating system. While VMs provide isolation via virtualized hardware, containers leverage the ability of the Linux kernel to provide isolated namespaces for individual processes. This lightweight nature means each application gets its own container, preventing dependency conflicts.

As a packaging mechanism, a container is typically just a tarball: a way to bundle the code, configuration and dependencies of an application into a single file. This eliminates the problem of “It worked on my environment, why doesn’t it work on yours,” because everything necessary to run the application consistently is transported with the container. Ideally, applications produce the same output regardless of environment, and containerization makes that ideal a lot easier to reach. The result is a containerized application that will start, stop, make requests and log the same way.

Container Benefits and Issues
.............................

For any business, containers represent a large opportunity:

- Developers will spend less time debugging environment issues and more time writing code. 
- Server bills will shrink, because more applications can fit on a server using containers than in traditional deployments. 
- Containers can run anywhere, increasing the available deployment options. For complex applications consisting of multiple components, containers vastly simplify updates. Placing each component in a container makes it simple to make changes without having to worry about unintended interactions with other components.

Use cases for containerized workloads include:

- Continuous Integration Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) development
- Application modernization/Microservices
- API, web, and backend app development/delivery
- Application cost containment
- Enabling hybrid cloud

While breaking down applications into microservices, or discrete functional parts, has clear benefits, having more parts to manage can introduce complexities for configuration, service discovery, load balancing, resource scaling, and discovering and fixing failures. Managing this complexity manually isn't scalable.

Introducing Kubernetes
......................

`Kubernetes <https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/what-is-kubernetes/>`_ is a container orchestration platform, open sourced by Google in 2014, that helps manage distributed, containerized applications at massive scale. According to Redmonk, 54 %of Fortune 100 companies are running Kubernetes in some form, with adoption coming from every sector.

.. figure:: images/overview2.jpg

Kubernetes delivers production-grade container orchestration, automating container configuration, simplifying scaling, lifecycle management, and managing resource allocation. Kubernetes can run anywhere. Whether you want your infrastructure to run on-premise, on a public cloud, or a hybrid configuration of both.

However, vanilla Kubernetes presents its own challenges that make it difficult for organizations to adopt the technology. Building your own production-ready deployment that ensures the Kubernetes environment itself is robust, easy to maintain (automated), with integrated features for things like networking, logging, analytics, and secret management, could take months.

Kubernetes aggressive, quarterly release cycle (where releases are deprecated by the community after 3 quarters) can create adoption challenges for enterprises. Finally, from a supportability and risk perspective, maintaining your own custom Kubernetes stack for production applications would be analogous to using a custom-made distribution of Linux - virtually unheard of in the enterprise.

As previously stated, Nutanix Karbon provides a turn-key solution to address these critical Kubernetes challenges.

Lab Setup
+++++++++

This lab requires applications provisioned as part of the :ref:`windows_tools_vm`.

If you have not yet deployed this VM, see the linked steps before proceeding with the lab.

It is **highly recommended** that you connect to the Tools VM using the Microsoft Remote Desktop client rather than the VM console launched via Prism. An RDP connection will allow you to copy and paste between your device and the VMs.

Creating a Karbon Cluster
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

In this exercise you will create a development Kubernetes cluster with Nutanix Karbon.

#. In **Prism Central**, select :fa:`bars` **> Services > Karbon**.

   .. figure:: images/karbon_create_cluster_0.png

   .. note::

     If Karbon has not already been enabled on your cluster, click the **Enable Karbon** button when prompted. Once clicked, the process should take approximately 2 minutes to complete. During this time Prism Central is deploying the Karbon control plane, which runs as a set of containers within the Prism Central VM.

     .. figure:: images/2.png

#. Click the provided link to launch the **Karbon Console**.

   .. note::

     If at any point your Karbon session times out, you can log in again using your Prism Central **admin** credentials.

#. Click **Download Centos** to download the required OS image to Karbon.

#. Once the download has completed, click **Clusters** in the sidebar on the left, then click **+ Create Kubernetes Cluster**.

#. On the **Recommended Configurations** tab, select **Development Cluster** and click **Next**.

   This will define a single worker node, master node, and etcd node.

   Worker nodes are responsible for running containers deployed onto the Kubernetes cluster. Each Worker node runs the `kubelet <https://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/kubelet/>`_ and `kube-proxy <https://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/kube-proxy/>`_ services.

   The Master node controls the Kubernetes cluster and provides the `kube-apiserver <https://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/kube-apiserver/>`_, `kube-controller-manager <https://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/kube-controller-manager/>`_. and `kube-scheduler <https://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/kube-scheduler/>`_ services.

  `etcd <https://coreos.com/etcd/>`_ nodes provide a distributed key-value store which Kubernetes uses to manage cluster state. In this lab, you will configure a single etcd node.

  .. figure:: images/karbon-configurations.png

#. On the **Name and Environment** tab, fill out the following fields:

   - **Name** - *Initials*-karbon
   - **Cluster** - Select *Your Nutanix cluster*
   - **Kubernetes Version** - 1.13.4 (Default)
   - **Host OS Image** - centos7.5.1804-ntnx-0.0 (Default)

   .. figure:: images/3.png

   .. note::

     Your cluster has been pre-staged with a compatible CentOS image for use with Karbon.

     Karbon currently supports CentOS 7.5.1804 and requires that the image be downloaded directly from Karbon **OS Images**.

#. Click **Next**.

   In the Node COnfiguration section you can select with Network VLAN will be used for your Karbon Kuburnetes Cluster.  Do note that only IPAM enabled networks can be used and must have enough IP addresses available to deploy the necessary container host VMs.  You can also view the resources defined for each type of container host VMs (worker, master, and etcd). If desired, you are able to edit the resource allocations by clicking **Edit** next to each type.

   For this lab, you can leave the default values.

#. Click **Next**.

   Next you will configure the networking for both the host VMs and pods. Karbon utilizes `Flannel <https://github.com/coreos/flannel#flannel>`_ to provide layer 3 IPv4 networking between multiple nodes within the Karbon cluster.

   Platforms like Kubernetes assume that each pod (container) has a unique, routable IP inside the cluster. The advantage of this model is that it removes the port mapping complexities that come from sharing a single host IP.

   The **Service CIDR Range** defines the network range on which services (like etcd) are exposed. The **Pod CIDR Range** defines the network range used to IP pods. The default configuration allows for a maximum of 256 nodes with up to 256 pods per node.

#. On the **Network** tab, fill out the following fields:

   - **Network Provider** - Flannel (Default)
   - **Service CIDR** - 172.19.0.0/16 (Default)
   - **Pod CIDR** - 172.20.0.0/16 (Default)

   .. figure:: images/6.png

#. Click **Next**.

#. On the **Storage Class** tab, fill out the following fields:

   - **Storage Class Name** - default-storageclass-*Initials* (initials in lowercase)
   - **Nutanix Cluster** - *Your Nutanix Cluster name*
   - **Nutanix Cluster Username** - admin
   - **Nutanix Cluster Password** - *Your password*
   - **Storage Container Name** - Default
   - **Reclaim Policy** - Delete (Default)
   - **File System** - ext4 (Default)

   .. figure:: images/7.png

#. Click **Create**.

   Deployment of the cluster should take approximately 10 minutes. During this time, Karbon is pulling images from the public image repositories for the **master**, **etcd**, and **worker** nodes, as well as **flannel**, the Nutanix Volumes plugin, and any additional Karbon plugins. Support for authenticated proxy and dark site image repositories will be added post-GA.

   Filtering VMs for *Initials*\ **-karbon** in **Prism Central** will display the master, etcd, and worker VMs provisioned by Karbon.

   .. figure:: images/8.png

   In **Prism Element > Storage > Volume Group**, Karbon has created the **pvc-...** Volume Group, used as persistent storage for logging. Karbon leverages the Nutanix Kubernetes Volume Plug-In to present Nutanix Volumes to Kubernetes pods via iSCSI. This allows containers to take advantage of native Nutanix storage capabilities such as thin provisioning, zero suppression, compression, and more.

   .. figure:: images/9.png

   The Karbon cluster has finished provisioning when the **Status** of the cluster is **Healthy**.

   .. figure:: images/10.png

#. Click on your cluster name (*Initials*\ **-karbon**) to access the Summary Page for your cluster.

   .. figure:: images/11.png

#. Explore this view and note the ability to create and add additional storage classes and persistent storage volumes to the cluster.

   Additional persistent storage volumes could be leveraged for use cases such as containerized databases.

   In 15 minutes or less, you have deployed a production-ready Kubernetes cluster with logging (EFK), networking (flannel), and persistent storage services.

Getting Started with Kubectl
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

`Kubectl <https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/overview/>`_ is the  command line interface for running commands against Kubernetes clusters. `Kubeconfig <https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/organize-cluster-access-kubeconfig/>`_ files contain information about clusters, users, namespaces, and authentication. The ``kubectl`` tool uses **kubeconfig** files to find and communicate with a Kubernetes cluster.

In this exercise you will use ``kubectl`` to perform basic operations against your newly provisioned Karbon cluster.

#. From within your *Initials*\ **-Windows-ToolsVM** VM, browse to **Prism Central** and open **Karbon**.

#. Select your *Initials*\ **-karbon** cluster and click **Actions > Download kubeconfig**.

   .. figure:: images/12.png

#. Click **Download**, then click **Close**.

#. Open **PowerShell**.

   .. note::

     If installed, you can also use a local instance of ``kubectl``. The Tools VM is provided to ensure a consistent experience.

     Instructions for setting up ``kubectl`` in Windows and macOS can be found `here <https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/>`_.

#. From PowerShell, run the following commands to configure ``kubectl``:

   .. code-block:: PowerShell

     cd ~
     mkdir .kube
     cd .kube
     mv ~\Downloads\*kubectl* ~\.kube\config
     kubectl get nodes

   .. note::

     By default, ``kubectl`` looks like a file named ``config`` in the ``~/.kube`` directory. Other locations can be specified using environment variables or by setting the ``--kubeconfig`` flag.

#. Verify that the output of the last command shows 1 master node and 1 worker node as **Ready**.

#. Next you will check the versions of the Kubernetes client and server by running the following command:

   .. code-block:: PowerShell

   	kubectl version

Deploying an Application
++++++++++++++++++++++++

Now that you have successfully run commands against your Kubernetes cluster using ``kubectl``, you are now ready to deploy an application. In this exercise you will be deploying the popular open-source content management system used for websites and blogs, Wordpress.

#. Using *Initials*\ **-Windows-ToolsVM**, open **PowerShell** and create a **wordpress** directory using the following command:

   .. code-block:: PowerShell

   	mkdir ~\wordpress
   	cd ~\wordpress

   Kubernetes depends on YAML files to provision applications and define dependencies. YAML files are a human-readable text-based format for specifying configuration information. This application requires two YAML files to be stored in the **wordpress** directory.

   .. note::

     To learn more about Kubernetes application deployment and YAML files, click `here <https://www.mirantis.com/blog/introduction-to-yaml-creating-a-kubernetes-deployment/>`_.

#. Using your *Initials*\ **-Windows-ToolsVM** web browser, download the following YAML files for Wordpress and the MySQL deployment used by Wordpress:

   - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nutanixworkshops/ts2019/master/karbon/mysql-deployment.yaml
   - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nutanixworkshops/ts2019/master/karbon/wordpress-deployment.yaml

   Kubernetes depends on YAML files to provision applications and define dependencies. YAML files are a human-readable text-based format for specifying configuration information. This application requires two YAML files to be stored in the **wordpress** directory.

  .. note::

  If attempting to download the script results in an Access Denied error, log out of any AWS accounts from your browser or open the download link in **Incognito (Private Browsing)** mode.

#. Move both files to the **wordpress** directory using the following command:

   .. code-block:: PowerShell

   	mv ~\Downloads\*.yaml ~\wordpress\
   	cd ~\wordpress\

#. Open the **wordpress-deployment.yaml** file with your preferred text editor.

   .. note::

     **Sublime Text** has been pre-installed on *Initials*\ **-Windows-ToolsVM**.

   .. figure:: images/13.png

#. Under **spec: > type:**, change the value from **LoadBalancer** to **NodePort** and save the file. (Using a LoadBalancer is outside the scope of this lab.)

   .. figure:: images/14.png

   .. note::

     You can learn more about Kubernetes publishing service types `here <https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#publishing-services-service-types>`_.

#. Open the **mysql-deployment.yaml** file and note that it requires an environmental variable to define the **MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD** as part of deployment. **No changes are required to this file.**

   .. figure:: images/14b.png

#. Define the **secret** to be used as the MySQL password by running the following command:

   .. code-block:: bash

   	kubectl create secret generic mysql-pass --from-literal=password=Nutanix/4u!

   Verify the command returns ``secret/mysql-pass created``.

   You can also verify the secret has been created by running the following command:

   .. code-block:: bash

   	kubectl get secrets

   Verify **mysql-pass** appears in the **NAME** column.

#. You will now provision the MySQL database by running the following command:

   .. code-block:: bash

   	kubectl create -f mysql-deployment.yaml

   .. figure:: images/15.png

#. In addition to the MySQL service, the **mysql-deployment.yaml** also specifies that a persistent volume be created as part of the deployment. You can get additional details about the volume by running:

   .. code-block:: bash

   	kubectl get pvc

   You will note that the **STORAGECLASS** matches the **default-storageclass-**\ *Initials* provisioned by Karbon.

   The volume also appears in **Karbon** under *Initials*\ **-karbon > Volume**.

   .. figure:: images/16.png

#. To view all running pods on the cluster, which should currently only be your Wordpress MySQL database, run the following command:

   .. code-block:: bash

   	kubectl get pods

#. To complete the application, deploy Wordpress by running the following command:

   .. code-block:: bash

   	kubectl create -f wordpress-deployment.yaml

#. Verify both pods are displayed as **Running** using ``kubectl get pods``.

Accessing Wordpress
+++++++++++++++++++

You have confirmed the Wordpress application and its MySQL database are running. Configuration of Wordpress is done via web interface, but to access the web interface you must first determine the IP addresses of our worker VMs and the port on which the pod is running.

#. The IP addresses of all cluster VMs is returned by the ``kubectl describe nodes`` command. You can run this and search for the **InternalIP** of any of your **worker** VMs, or run the following command to return only the hostnames and IP addresses:

   .. code-block:: PowerShell

   	kubectl describe nodes | Select-String -Pattern "Hostname:","InternalIP"

   .. figure:: images/17.png

#. To determine the port number of the Wordpress application, run the following command and note the TCP port mapped to port 80:

   .. code-block:: bash

   	kubectl get services wordpress

   .. figure:: images/18.png

#. Open \http://*WORKER-VM-IP:WORDPRESS SERVICE PORT*/ in a new browser tab to access to Wordpress installation.

   .. note::

     In the example shown, you would browse to http://10.21.78.72:32160. You environment will have a different IP and port.

   .. figure:: images/19.png

#. Click **Continue** and fill out the following fields:

   - **Site Title** - *Initials*\ 's Karbon Blog
   - **Username** - admin
   - **Password** - nutanix/4u
   - **Your Email** - noreply@nutanix.com

#. Click **Install Wordpress**.

#. After setup completes (a few seconds), click **Log In** and provide the credentials just configured.

   Congratulations! Your Wordpress application and MySQL database setup is complete.

Exploring Logging & Visualization
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Karbon provides a plug-in architecture to continually add additional functionality on top of vanilla Kubernetes. The firsts plug-ins Karbon provides are an integrated logging services stack called **EFK**, short for `Elasticsearch <https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch>`_, `fluentd <https://www.fluentd.org/>`_ and `Kibana <https://github.com/elastic/kibana>`_; and monitoring and alerting with Prometheus.

Elasticsearch is a real-time, distributed, and scalable search engine which allows for full-text and structured search, as well as analytics. It is commonly used to index and search through large volumes of log data, but can also be used to search many different kinds of documents.

Elasticsearch is commonly deployed alongside Kibana, a powerful data visualization frontend and dashboard for Elasticsearch. Kibana allows you to explore your Elasticsearch log data through a web interface, and build dashboards and queries to quickly answer questions and gain insight into your Kubernetes applications.

Fluentd is a popular data collector that runs on all Kubernetes nodes to tail container log files, filter and transform the log data, and deliver it to the Elasticsearch cluster, where it will be indexed and stored.

#. Return to the **Karbon Console** and select your *Initials*\ **-karbon** cluster.

#. Select **Add-on** from the sidebar to view and manage available Karbon plugins.

   .. figure:: images/21.png

#. Select **Logging** to launch the Kibana user interface.

#. Select **Discover** from the sidebar and define ``*`` as the **Index Pattern**.

   This wildcard will retrieve all available indices within Elastisearch, including **etcd**, **kubernetes**, and **systemd**.

   .. figure:: images/22.png

#. Click **Next Step**.

#. Select **@timestamp** from the **Time Filter field name** drop down menu to allow you to sort logging entries by their respective timestamps.

#. Click **Create index pattern**.

#. Select **Discover** again from the sidebar to view all logs from the Karbon cluster. You can reduce the amount of Kubernetes metadata displayed by adding the **log** entry under **Available Fields**.

   .. figure:: images/23.png

   Advanced Kibana usage, including time series data visualization that can answer questions such as "What is the difference in service error rates between our last 3 application upgrades," is covered in the `Kibana User Guide <https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/6.2/index.html>`_.
